# gan2pulses
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to create pulses from scintillators.

List of files:
- *ganpulses.py*. Main code to execute.
- *source1.mat*. Matlab file with the scintillator raw pulses.
- *distances.py*. Utility functions related to the distances. Not all of them are used for the main code.

Notes:
- This code has been tested using 'Spyder 4'.
- The choice of Cs-137 or Na-22 is made by uncommenting the code indicated in it.
- Note that most of the code has to do with the measurement of results rather than with the GAN itself.
